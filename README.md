# code2040

Thank you so much for participating in a phone interview with us. It was great getting to learn more about you and your interest in the Code2040 Fellows Program.

We’ve had a very competitive pool and have had to make hard decisions, and unfortunately we won’t be able to advance you into the next stage of our application process. We have no doubt, though, that you’ll be a real asset to the tech industry and we will continue to consider you part of the Code2040 community.

We strongly encourage you to review our Applicant Playbook and keep an eye out for opportunities offered through our Technical Applicant Prep (TAP) Program. By signing-up for the TAP Newsletter you will have the opportunity to participate in online and in-person programming throughout the year.

Thank you, again, for your interest in the Fellows Program and please let us know if you have any questions.

Best,
Code2040 Team
